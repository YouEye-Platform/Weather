# YouEye Weather

Multi-location weather app for the [YouEye](https://github.com/YouEye-Platform/YouEye) platform.

Weather runs as a native YouEye app. It provides current conditions, forecasts, dashboard widgets, and timeline cards with account and settings integration supplied by YouEye.

Current development source version: `0.4.3.1.0.2`

## Features

- Current conditions with temperature, humidity, wind, and UV index
- Hourly and multi-day forecasts
- Multiple saved locations
- Location search with geocoding
- Current weather and forecast dashboard widgets
- Timeline info-card surface for weather summaries
- App-owned settings panel for YouEye Settings
- Theme, language, and account menu integration
- PWA-ready build with service worker assets

## YouEye Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Main Weather app |
| `/embed/widget/weather-current` | Dashboard current weather widget |
| `/embed/widget/weather-forecast` | Dashboard forecast widget |
| `/embed/card/weather` | Timeline/info-card surface |
| `/embed/settings` | App settings panel shown inside YouEye Settings |
| `/api/manifest` | Native app manifest consumed by Market and UI |
| `/api/health` | Container health and version endpoint |

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app uses Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Open-Meteo data, and YouEye's native app surface contract.

## Build and release checks

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm release:check
pnpm build
```

The source-owned `.youeye/build/app` entrypoint produces an unsigned
`standalone.tar` for independent validation, signing, and publication. It
requires the build environment described in `.youeye/build/manifest.json`.
Package and install-manifest versions must agree. Development tags use
`dev-v<version>`; Stable tags use `v<version>`.

The install manifest retains the Forgejo source identity. The public project
website is documentation metadata, not an instruction to switch update sources.
See [PUBLIC_RELEASE_POLICY.md](PUBLIC_RELEASE_POLICY.md) for publication rules.

## Acting user and household admission

Private routes derive the acting identity from `getSession(appId)`, which checks
the native cookie and current identity session through the configured client.
Never use a browser-supplied `X-YouEye-User`, `userId` or `user_id` to select
private rows or nominate the user of a platform service call. Household admission
and per-user service consent are separate checks; administrative status does not
grant access to every app.

Widget, card and inter-app routes require a native session. Inter-app factories
receive an explicit app ID and pass `{ userId }` as the second handler argument;
user fields are removed from request data. A server-to-server caller without a
validated native session is denied. Header/body identity nomination is not a
supported delegation protocol. Existing explicitly public shares and public
content remain distinct from private routes, and external public exposure must
be chosen by the appliance administrator.

## App service credentials

Platform calls run on the server with the protected `YOUEYE_APP_ID`,
`YOUEYE_APP_TOKEN` and `YOUEYE_GATEWAY` values injected by the installer.
The app ID is the exact installed ID; helpers do not invent prefix aliases.
A missing credential fails with an integration-not-ready error. Use Market's
administrator credential reconciliation action to repair delivery.

Pass the acting user from a validated server session. Caller-supplied headers
cannot replace machine identity, select another user, or attach a browser/bridge
credential. Keep platform helpers in server code and keep runtime credentials
out of source, browser bundles and logs. Public health/manifests do not need a
service credential. Rotation and restore reinject a credential and prove it
before marking integration ready.
