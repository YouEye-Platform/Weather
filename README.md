## YouEye Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Main Weather app |
| `/embed/widget/weather-current` | Dashboard current weather widget |
| `/embed/widget/weather-forecast` | Dashboard forecast widget |

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Build and release checks

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm release:check
pnpm build
```

The source-owned `.youeye/build/app` entrypoint produces an unsigned
`standalone.tar` for independent validation, signing, and publication. It
requires the build environment described in `.youeye/build/manifest.json`.
Package and install-manifest versions must agree. Development tags use
`dev-v<version>`; Stable tags use `v<version>`.

The install manifest retains the Forgejo source identity. The public project
website is documentation metadata, not an instruction to switch update sources.
